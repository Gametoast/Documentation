* The included 'core-ModTools.req' file is the core.req file from the ModTools.
	It is not the original 'core.req' file; it's intent is for creating the core.lvl 'Localization only' file for mods.

* 'core-japanese.req' came with the ModTools.

* The included 'core.req' file is an attempt to reconstruct the original core.req file and is un-tested.
	The XBOX shader portion is a little more difficult to verify due to some files that only seem to show up as
	'.TNFL' in LVLTool.
	The GOG core.lvl file was inspected for the PC content of core.req.
