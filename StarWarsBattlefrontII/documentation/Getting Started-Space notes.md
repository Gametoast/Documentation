**Getting Started Space Notes**

These notes go over what is different in Visual Munge for Star Wars Battlefront II when creating a Space level.

You&#39;ll see a different List of Game Modes when you check the Space Map box.

- CW Assault will create a Clone Wars Space Assault map template

- CW CTF will create a Clone Wars Space CTF map template

- GCW Assault will create a Galactic Civil War Space Assault map template

- GCW CTF will create a Galactic Civil War Space CTF map template

Each template contains

2 Capital ships (one on either side)

2 Frigates (one on either side)

8 vehicle spawn points (4 on either side, one of each class)

2 Command Posts (one on either side)

12 Auto turrets (6 on either side)

12 Remote turrets (6 on either side)

Galactic Civil War maps also have 4 heavy turrets used for ship to ship combat. (2 on either side)

So what&#39;s next?

Well, after you&#39;ve followed the instructions in the normal Getting Started guide, you&#39;ll still need to do the following.

_MOVE THE SHIPS!!!_

**Placement**

No matter what era or gametype you&#39;ve made, you&#39;ll probably want to move the ships about the world and see what cool layouts you can get. You&#39;ll need to move whole groups of objects to keep things in line. You&#39;ll also need to move spawn paths, regions, objects and all that good stuff. That&#39;s why this is the first thing you need to do. If you make changes to the world and lay out barriers and paths, you&#39;ll kick yourself if you want a different layout after the fact.

_AI Ground Control_

**Barriers!**

AI need barriers to move smoothly through the level. Use the editor to set these up.

**Planning Graphs**

AI need planning graphs to figure out how to move through the hanger and back areas a little more intelligently. It&#39;s not crucial, but it can help make the AI look more intelligent.

**Paths!**

Read the FlyerSplineFollowing.txt file and check out the funnest thing since fun street. Lay out spline paths that take your AI flyers out of the hangar and into space. Then layout paths that fly around your newly setup world. This is quite a chore, I&#39;m not going to lie to you. But it&#39;s a fairly simple task that will infuriate you. That&#39;s why you have to do it. Feel free to ask on the [www.gametoast.com](http://www.gametoast.com/) boards for more information regarding paths. ÔÅä
