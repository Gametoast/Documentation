**Battlefront II Space LUA Guide**

Space Scripting

The following three lua examples will walk you through the basics of lua editing and setup for Battlefront II space levels.

To begin, I'll note that most of the general lua stuff is covered in previous docs, so this will ONLY cover items that are space specific.

The following file is found the Template folder and is @#$c_cmn. This is a common (cmn) lua file that is referenced by the game mode files to ease the clutter that can (and will) build up in a lua file. Parts of the lua have been removed to only focus on what you need to learn for space.

```LUA
--  LinkedTurrets is a lua file that handles the turret mainframe functionality of Space levels. Technically, you could use this on any 
-- kind of map to allow one central object control a number of turrets.
ScriptCB_DoFile("LinkedTurrets")

function SetupTurrets()
    
    --CIS turrets
    
    -- turretLinkageCIS is an array of turrets as well as their controlling device. For the script portion below, "cis-defense" is the controlling 
    -- device, and "cis_turr_1-6" are the individual turrets
    
    turretLinkageCIS = LinkedTurrets:New{ 
            team = CIS, 
            mainframe = "cis-defense",
            turrets = {"cis_turr_1", "cis_turr_2", "cis_turr_3", "cis_turr_4", "cis_turr_5", "cis_turr_6"} 
    }
    
    turretLinkageCIS:Init()
    
    -- function turretLinkageCIS:OnDisableMainframe() sets up the localized text for the action of disabling (destroying) the mainframe
    -- ShowMessageText("level.spa.hangar.mainframe.atk.down", REP)
    --    This line will reference the line found within "level.spa.hangar.mainframe.atk.down" and display it for the REP side when the 
    --    mainframe is disabled.
    
    -- BroadcastVoiceOver( "ROSMP_obj_20", REP )
    --    This line will look for the sound call "ROSMP_obj_20" and play it for the REP side when the mainframe is disabled.
    
    function turretLinkageCIS:OnDisableMainframe()
        ShowMessageText("level.spa.hangar.mainframe.atk.down", REP)
        ShowMessageText("level.spa.hangar.mainframe.def.down", CIS)
        BroadcastVoiceOver( "ROSMP_obj_20", REP )
        BroadcastVoiceOver( "COSMP_obj_21", CIS )
    end
    
    -- Similar to the above scripting, the lines below perform text and sound duties when the mainframe is enables (repaired). 
    -- This will not play the status of the mainframe when the map starts, only when the mainframe is repaired.
    function turretLinkageCIS:OnEnableMainframe()
        ShowMessageText("level.spa.hangar.mainframe.atk.up", REP)
        ShowMessageText("level.spa.hangar.mainframe.def.up", CIS)
        BroadcastVoiceOver( "ROSMP_obj_22", REP )
        BroadcastVoiceOver( "COSMP_obj_23", CIS )
    end
end

-- SetWorldExtents and ScriptPreInit go hand in hand. When building a Space level, you may notice that when you exit your 
-- ship you instantly die. You also might find that running around certain parts of your ship you will die without taking damage. 
-- That's what SetWorldExtents is for. If you have this set to 2500, but you're still finding that the world is killing you 
-- (and you're not walking into a death region) then bump it up to enlarge the soldier based playable space.

function ScriptPreInit()
    SetWorldExtents(2500)
end

function ScriptInit()

    -- Ahh flyheights. These are easy. These values control how far from the center of the world the player can fly up or down. 
    -- These are used on ground based maps to limit the jet classes and jedi, but is also used to keep flyers from getting too 
    -- high or too far below the space battlefield. To find an appropriate height, use PrintPlayerPos in the console, fly to 
    -- your desired max/min height, and punch those numbers in. It's best to keep the Max/MinFlyHeight and the Max/MinPlayerFlyHeight 
    -- in line with each other to avoid AI doing things that players can't.
    SetMinFlyHeight(-1800)
    SetMaxFlyHeight(1800)
    SetMinPlayerFlyHeight(-1800)
    SetMaxPlayerFlyHeight(1800)
    
    --Notify Radius is the distance around a waiting craft from which AI can be lured in.
    SetAIVehicleNotifyRadius(100)
    
    -- SetupTeams has been explained before, but I wanted to point out that myTeamConfig is found in both cmn.lua files and 
    -- the 1flag.lua files because while cmn.lua files actually setup the teams for all modes that call that lua, sometimes 
    -- you need a mode that has a different loadout of units. For example, Space Marines aren't needed for CTF, so they aren't 
    -- called in myTeamConfig in the 1flag.luas.
    SetupUnits()
    SetupTeams(myTeamConfig)
    
    -- In the level stats section of your lua, remember to allocate memory for as many flyers as you'll need, as well as Command Flyers.
    
    -- Level Stats
    SetMemoryPoolSize("EntityFlyer", 36)
    SetMemoryPoolSize("CommandFlyer", 2)
    
    -- As the comment states, myScriptInit is for custom pool allocations for a specific mode or custom loading of assets or teams.
    
    -- do any pool allocations, custom loading here
    if myScriptInit then
        myScriptInit()
        myScriptInit = nil
    end
    
    -- ReadDataFile regarding sky files: Most of this work has been done by the development team for the actual shipped product, 
    -- so you have less to worry about unless you make your own skydome and such. All you have to do is replace "tat" with the 
    -- three letters that correspond to the planet you want the battle to take place over. "cor" for Coruscant, "hot" for Hoth, etc.
    ReadDataFile("SPA\\spa_sky.lvl", "tat")
    
    -- ReadDataFile regarding gamemodes and your levels' lvl file: myGameMode corresponds to the gamemode inside of your gamemodes' lua. 
    -- For example, this finds the line in the 1flag lua that reads "myGameMode = "@#$_CW-CTF"" and adds the "@#$_CW-CTF" portion in 
    -- place of "myGameMode" in the cmn script.
    ReadDataFile("SPA\\@#$.lvl", myGameMode)
    
    -- This line is needed for particles in space to work properly, don't delete it!
    SetParticleLODBias(15000)
    
    -- AddDeathRegion("deathregion3") the name of the deathregion is placed where "deathregion3" is in this line. Sounds obvious, 
    -- I know, but keep this in mind because if you don't add the death region, it won't be active in your level.
    AddDeathRegion("deathregion3")
    
    -- AddLandingRegion works like adding a death region. These regions will restrict the landing capabilities for all flyers in your 
    -- level to be within the specified region. If no landing region is defined, players will be able to land and then takeoff from anywhere in the map.
    AddLandingRegion("rep-CP1Con")
    
    -- End of the script!
    
end
```

This completes the documentation of a common space script. Now we'll take a look at 1 Flag CTF and Assault maps. I won't be covering these scripts in their entirety, since they have their common items inside the common script.
