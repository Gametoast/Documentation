<b>FLYTHROUGH MOVIES FOR STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT</b><p>



VIDEO ASSET DEVELOPMENT AND COMPRESSION:<br>

Star Wars Battlefront flythroughs, the short video clip showcasing the level in the map select screen, are captured and edited as .avi’s and then compressed into .bik’s using Bink Video by RAD Game Tools INC. The flythroughs are titled using the naming convention of “map1fly.bik” where “map1” is the name of the map. The .bik’s are  following the recommended compression guidelines listed on the Rad Game Tools website at: <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/binkhcwb.htm" target=newwindow">http://www.radgametools.com/binkhcwb.htm</a>. These guidelines are a helpful reference, but of course results will vary depending on the content makeup of the video clip. Experimentation to achieve the delicate balance of good image quality at a low file size is the name of the game.
<p>


As a starting point, here are the settings used on average for the flythroughs on Star Wars Battlefront:
<p>


Overall data rate settings: Compress to a data rate (bytes) of 750000<br>

Keep peak data rate under a multiple of the overall data rate 3.0<br>

No scaling compression<br>

How many frames to preview during bandwidth allocation: 12<br>

Width: 640<br>

Height: 480<br>

Contrast: 8<br>

Smooth %: 3<br>

Deinterlace: On<br>


<p>


SCRIPTING TO INCORPORATE INTO THE GAME SHELL:<br>


The next step is to get the .bik file into the shell of the game.
<p>


First, go to the folder of where the movie assets are contained:
<p>


Downloadable content\DataTAT3\_SOURCE_PC\Shell\Movies
<p>


This directory contains the .bik movie and a .mlst text file. For example<br>

Tat3fly.bik<br>

Tat3.mlst<p>



Place the flythrough movie in this directory and create a .mlst text file. The .mlst text file is titled the map name with a .mlst extension, for example, “tat3.mlst”. This is a text file that simply has one line of text:
<p>

..\..\_SOURCE_PC\shell\movies\tat3fly.bik
<p>


Second, go to another directory that contains the scripting file for how the movie should behave:
<p>


Downloadable content\DataTAT3\Shell\Movies
<p>


This directory contains .mcfg text files. The .mcfg text file is titled the map name with a .mcfg file extension, for example, “tat3.mcfg”. This is a text file that has a few lines of scripting:
<p>

<pre>
// transition times used by all movies

MovieProperties()
{
    Name("flythrough_template");
    FadeInTime(1.0);
    FadeOutTime(1.0);
}


// Level fly throughs...
// TAT3

MovieProperties()

{
    Name("tat3fly");
    Inherit("flythrough_template");
    Movie("tat3");
    SegmentList()
    {
        Segment("tat3fly", 1.0, -1);
    }

}
</pre>

<p>
These are all the components used in creating and displaying your flythrough to accompany your map in the shell of the map select screen.
