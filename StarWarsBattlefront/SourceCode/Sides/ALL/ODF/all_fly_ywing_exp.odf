//"Scale" values determine if the weapons damage is reduced or increased as

//"Shake" sets the intensity of the camera shaking
//"Push" sets the amount of force a unit in the explosion will be hit with.
//This can cause them to be thrown outward or upward at varyying heights.
//"Length" this value sets how long the shake will last for.
//"Radius" values determine at what distance from the center of the explosion
//things will be affected by Push or Shake
